# Summary

This project is a Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) about Brazilian dairy milk production. This project was developed during my graduation in [Applied Computing](http://cursos.unipampa.edu.br/cursos/ppgcap/) in [Federal University of Pampa](http://novoportal.unipampa.edu.br/novoportal/), in partnership with [Brazilian Agricultural Research Colorporation](https://www.embrapa.br/en/international), also known as Embrapa.
The content of this project can be found in this [Expanded Resume](http://publicase.unipampa.edu.br/index.php/siepe/article/view/40708). It is in portuguese, but in time, I can provide an english version of it.

[All figures created can be found here](https://github.com/Lubrum/Brazilian-Milk-Production/tree/master/figures).

# Motivation

Get a better understanding of Brazilian dairy milk production, with main focus on Rio Grande do Sul (RS) state. RS is a state from south of Brazil. 

# Tools 

I used R language and both RStudio IDE and Jupyter to perform all analysis.

# What is data about?

Dairy Milk Production by RS city, Dairy Milk Production by Brazilian state, Dairy Milk production of RS over the years and number of rural properties that produced milk in RS state.

# What data is available?

- [Brazilian Milk Production and RS milk production over the years](https://sidra.ibge.gov.br/tabela/74). 

- Brazilian Milk Production and RS milk production in [2006](https://sidra.ibge.gov.br/tabela/933) and [2017](https://sidra.ibge.gov.br/tabela/6913).

- Brazilian and RS dairy milk properties in [2006](https://sidra.ibge.gov.br/tabela/1227) and [2017](https://sidra.ibge.gov.br/tabela/6913).
